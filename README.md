# Morse Time

Morse Code Display with various fonts - (c) Dec 17, 2023 By LeRoy Miller, KD8BXP  
Display a interesting font (time) on a M5StickC.  
The fonts used here were all found from fontspace.com  
This based on the useless clock code, but only uses UTC for display - the other times are displayed out to the serial monitor.  
Minor changes will need to be made to the location of the clock for each font above
near line 169 and 172  
Fonts change be changed by uncommenting the font you'd like above and changing the font name (also near line 169)  
TTF fonts were converted using https://rop.nl/truetype2gfx/  
Add your WiFi SSID and Password to the creds.h file.
